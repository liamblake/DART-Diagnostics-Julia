# DART-Diagnostics-Julia
This repository translates the diagnostic MATLAB code of the [Data Assimilation Research Testbed](https://github.com/NCAR/DART) to Julia. Still a WIP!

## Dependencies 

- [NCDatasets.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeo/NCDatasets.jl) for reading the NetCDF files generated by the DART Fortran programs. 
- [PyPlot.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyPlot.jl) for generating plots. This could probably be done in base plots (future work?) but it's easier to directly translate the MATPLAB plotting code with this package.
